The map has loops
If we count the loops, the count is too high?

Not understanding the requirement fully. The guard could leave the map in any direction

- Using set in python
 _set = set([]) # init a empty set

- add() / pop() an element to set


Part 2:
------
The map have the infinite loop
part 2 takes 54 minutes, with brute force
Using hashmap to reduce the execution time of loop detective
